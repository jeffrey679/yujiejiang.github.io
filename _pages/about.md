I am a final year Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at Rice University, under supervision of [Dr. Wenyi Wang](https://odin.mdacc.tmc.edu/~wwang7/) from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Prior to my Ph.D. study, I recieved my bachelor's degree in both Computer Science and Statistics at Wake Forest University in North Carolina.

My broad interests include convex optimization, high-dimensional data analysis, and application of modern machine learning techniques. My current research is in developing methodology ideas and efficient softwares that accurately analyze high-throughput genomic data.

Outside of work, my hobbies include basketball, weight lifting, classical music, and cooking.
